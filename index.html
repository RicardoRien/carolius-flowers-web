        <h1>Rosa</h1>
        <p>
          The <strong>rose</strong> was sacred to Venus (mythology). Venus was the Roman goddess of love and beauty. It
          was also linked with Cupid (son of Venus). He was the Roman god of desire – in one myth, he dropped nectar and
          the nectar bubbled up from the ground as roses. The rose was also sacred to Bacchus. He was the Roman god of
          wine.

        <h1>Helianthus annuus</h1>

          "<strong>sunflower</strong>" and "<strong>common sunflower</strong>". Sunflowers are usually tall annual or
          perennial plants that in some species can grow to a height of 300 cm (120 in) or more.

        <h1>Dionaea muscipula</h1>
        <p>
          The <strong>Venus flytrap</strong> is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of
          the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina. It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with
          a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny
          hairs on their inner surfaces.

          the Japanese cherry, Prunus serrulata, which is commonly called <strong>sakura</strong>. They are widely
          distributed, especially in the temperate zone of the Northern Hemisphere including Japan, Taiwan, Korea,

        <h1>Dahlia</h1>
        <p>
          <strong>Dahlias</strong> are perennial plants with tuberous roots, though they are grown as annuals in some
          regions with cold winters. While some have herbaceous stems, others have stems which lignify in the absence of
          secondary tissue and resprout following winter dormancy, allowing further seasons of growth.
